#*
 #  The <tt>ResizingArrayStack</tt> class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack
 #  of generic items.
 #  It supports the usual <em>push</em> and <em>pop</em> operations, along with methods
 #  for peeking at the top item, testing if the stack is empty, and iterating through
 #  the items in LIFO order.
 #  <p>
 #  This implementation uses a resizing array, which double the underlying array
 #  when it is full and halves the underlying array when it is one-quarter full.
 #  The <em>push</em> and <em>pop</em> operations take constant amortized time.
 #  The <em>size</em>, <em>peek</em>, and <em>is-empty</em> operations takes
 #  constant time in the worst case. 
 #  <p>

# Lecture Week 2 Resizing Arrays (09:56)
# 00:51 17 PROBLEM. Requiring client to provide capacity does not implement API!
# Q. How to grow and shrink array?
#
# FIRST TRY.
#   * push(): increase size of array s[] by 1
#   * pop():  decrease size of array s[] by 1
#
# TOO EXPENSIVE. QUADRATIC TIME (Infeasible for large N)
#   * Need to copy all items to a new array.
#   * Inserting first N items takes time proportional to 1 + 2 +...+ N ~ N^2/2

# 02:41 18 REPEAT DOUBLING
#
# CONSEQUENCE. Inserting first N items takes time proportional to N (not N^2)
# COST OF INSERTING FIRST N ITEMS. N + (2 + 4 + 8 + ... + N) ~ 3N
#   N -> 1 array access per push
#   (2...N) -> k array acesses to double to size k (ignoring cost to create new array)

# 04:30 Q. How to shrink array?
#
# FIRST TRY.
#  * push(): double size of array s[] when array is full.
#  * pop():  halve  size of array s[] when array is ONE-HALF FULL.
#
# TOO EXPENSIVE IN WORST CASE. (THRASHING)
#  * Consider push-pop-push-pop-... sequcne when array is full.
#  * Each operation takes time proportional to N.
#    N = 5 |to   |be   |or   |not  |to   |None |None |None |
#    N = 4 |to   |be   |or   |not  |
#    N = 5 |to   |be   |or   |not  |to   |None |None |None |
#    N = 4 |to   |be   |or   |not  |

# 05:09 INVARIANT. Array is between 25% and 100% full.

# 06:45 STACK RESIZING-ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION: PERFORMANCE
# 
# AMORTIZED ANALYSIS. Average running time per operation over
# a worst-case sequence of operations.
#
# PROPOSITION. Starting from an empty stack, any seauence of M push and
# pop operations takes time proportional to M.
#
# Order of growth of running time for resizing stack with N items:
#
#            | best | worst | amortized
#            +------+-------+----------
#  construct |    1 |     1 |         1
#  push      |    1 |     N |         1  N->Doubling operation
#  pop       |    1 |     N |         1  N->Halfing  operation
#  size      |    1 |     1 |         1

# 07:34 STACK RESIZING-ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION: MEMORY USAGE
# 
# PROPOSITION. Uses between ~8N and ~32N bytes to represent a stack with N items.
#   * ~8N when full.
#   * ~32N when one quarter full.
#
# public class ResizingArrayStackOfStrings
# {                       24 bytes (array overhead)
#                          8 bytes (reference to array)
#   private String[] s; <- 8 bytes x array size
#   private int N = 0;  <- 4 bytes int
#   ...                    4 bytes (padding)
# }
# 
# REMARK. Analysis includes memory for the stack
# (but not the strings themselves, which the client owns).

# 08:04 TRADEOFFS. Can implement a stack with either resizing array or linked list;
# client can use interchangeably. Which one is better?
#
# LINKED-LIST IMPLEMENTATION. (SLOWER) GUARANTED that each op is fast.
#  * Every operation takes constant time in the WORST CASE.
#  * Uses extra time and space to deal with the links.
# 
# RESIZING-ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION. (FASTER for each operation. But delays upon resizing)
#  * Every operation takes constant AMORTIZED time.
#  * Less wasted space.
