From the Q+A.

Q. Does Dijkstra's algorithm work with negative weights?

A. Yes and no. There are two shortest paths algorithms known
as Dijkstra's algorithm, depending on whether a vertex can
be enqueued on the priority queue more than once. When the
weights are nonnegative, the two versions coincide (as no
vertex will be enqueued more than once). The version
implemented in DijkstraSP.java (which allows a vertex to be
enqueued more than once) is correct in the presence of
negative edge weights (but no negative cycles) but its
running time is exponential in the worst case. (We note that
DijkstraSP.java throws an exception if the edge-weighted
digraph has an edge with a negative weight, so that a
programmer is not surprised by this exponential behavior.)
If we modify DijkstraSP.java so that a vertex cannot be
enqueued more than once (e.g., using a marked[] array to
mark those vertices that have been relaxed), then the
algorithm is guaranteed to run in E log V time but it may
yield incorrect results when there are edges with negative
weights.

Excellent answer. And Is there a Q&A part in the forum? Or
where is the Q+A part from? I search through the Q&A part in
the textbook and the slides, but not found a question
exactly like this one.

It both in the Q+A on the booksite and in recent printings
of the textbook. You may have an old printing of the
textbook.
