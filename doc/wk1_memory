Given the following definition of a MysteryBox object: 

public class MysteryBox {             16       16
    private long x0, x1, x2, x3;     4*8       32
    private boolean y0, y1, y2;      3*1        3
    private double z0, z1, z2;       3*8       24
    private int[] a = new int[96]; 4*96 + 24  408
                                        +  8    8 = 491
                                                5 padding
                                              496

    ...
}

Using the 64-bit memory cost model from lecture, how many bytes does each object of type MysteryBox use?
